;;; The RECUR data type implementation involves iteration across RECUR
;;; instances. Iteration is used in order to implement the COUNT and BYSETPOS
;;; rules basically. In the special case these rules are not present, we will
;;; say the recur is _simple_. We will use `%simple-recur-instance-p'.
;;; However, the iteration mechanism will works anyway.
;;;
;;; According to FREQ recur rule, the BY* rules could be classified in
;;; expansion rules and limitation ones. On the one hand, the expansion rules,
;;; are used to select what datetimes of a interval are instances in a
;;; recur. On the other hand, the limitation rules are used in order to
;;; distinguish which intervals are candidate to contain instances. See BYDAY
;;; for some exceptions. This is implemented in the source code described here
;;; by couples of functions which are named %recur-list-instances-* and
;;; %recur-next-*, respectively. These functions ignore COUNT and BYSETPOS
;;; recur rules.
;;;
;;; Finally, `recur-iterator-new' and `recur-iterator-next' will dispatch upon
;;; previous functions, in addition of add support for COUNT and BYSETPOS
;;; rules. A high level macro `do-recur-instances' is also provided.
