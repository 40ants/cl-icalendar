;;;; Compatibility CLOS Layer
;;; 
;;; The component-object provides a close abstraction to the described
;;; one in the RFC5545 document about components and; properties.
;;; However, it does not provide a pleasant abstraction to the user in
;;; order to handle them.
;;;
;;; Thereforce, in order to provide that abstraction, we build a layer
;;; of compatibility upon CLOS, using the Meta-Object Protocol
;;; (MOP). The main result is the component-class metaobject, which is
;;; an extension to the default standard-class, which could be
;;; extended by the user too.
;;; 
;;; The classes which are instances of component-class are always
;;; subclasses of component-object. A new allocation method named
;;; :property is avalaible for the slots; in fact, this is the default
;;; allocation method for component-class' instances. The user could
;;; override it to the standard :instance or :class methods yet. There
;;; some special options for property-allocated slots. See
;;; property-definition class.
;;;
;;; The usual operations on a slot have special effects on
;;; property-allocated slots, modifying the property table of the
;;; component in a hopefully intuitive and predictible way. Indeed the
;;; property-allocated slots know about property metainformation as
;;; type, default-type, single and multiple-valued properties, so they
;;; do more intensive error-checking to help to create well-formed
;;; iCalendar objects.
